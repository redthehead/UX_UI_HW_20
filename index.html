                    Key takeaways:
                    Greatest pain point was the overwhelm people felt when searching for
                    good deals
                    Most app used to find a place to stay = Airbnb
                    People do not want to spend hours trying to find a deal
                    This leads to burnout and under-planned trips
                    Typically people are not willing to pay for an app or subscription that 
                    tells them the best discounts or deals available

                    allows them to spend their money on experiences

                    out on other things they could do, see or eat
